Hi! I'm a passionate machine learning enthusiast currently pursuing my Master's degree at the prestigious University of Warsaw. My scientific journey revolves around the world of large language models (LLMs), where I delve into benchmarking, model alignment, and security.

I'm particularly excited about the intersection of machine learning and political science, exploring how these tools can be applied to gain deeper insights into political processes and phenomena.

Beyond the realm of academia, I'm a proud cat mom to three furry companions who bring endless joy to my life.

If you share my interests and are looking to collaborate on exciting machine learning projects, I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out to me at wisniosemilia[at]gmail.com. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
